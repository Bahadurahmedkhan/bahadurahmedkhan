- 🔭 I’m currently working on **product development efforts across multiple SaaS platforms — transforming ideas into scalable, user-centric solutions. Most recently, I’ve contributed to the success of projects like 24/7 Truckin, Heylo System, and V-Turbo Tech.AI, where I’ve played hybrid roles in product ownership, UX, and agile delivery.**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **AI in Product Management, Prompt Engineering, and Data-Driven Product Strategy. I'm also exploring advanced leadership techniques to evolve from product execution to visionary product leadership.**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **AI-driven or impact-focused digital products that create meaningful change. I thrive in agile product development environments where cross-functional teams come together to build user-centric solutions. Additionally, I'm open to contributing to cross-border open-source projects that aim to solve real-world problems and make technology more accessible.**

- 📓 The most valuable lessons I’ve learned from my product journey is **what you watch determines what you build. Your environment, curiosity, and awareness shape your product thinking. I’ve also come to believe that adaptability is one of the most powerful skills a product manager can develop — the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn.**

- 📝 I love writing about **my personal life experiences and the lessons they've taught me, especially as they relate to growth, resilience, and leadership. I also enjoy sharing insights from the world of product management — from real-world challenges to strategic thinking, agile processes, and team dynamics.**  

- 💬 Ask me about **Breaking into product management from a non-traditional path, leading agile teams with empathy, creating scalable product documentation, driving mentorship and community initiatives, and balancing lifelong learning with execution.**
